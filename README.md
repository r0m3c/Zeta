## App Description
<p>
    Hello ðŸ‘‹, my name is Leandro Gamarra. Welcome to my newest iOS Application project, Zeta. Zeta is a social media Application, where a user will be able to sign into the app, through Firebase Verification, and begin posting/uploading posts, with comments, to the main screen page. On top of this, anyone who has the app installed will be able to view each users posts, and will be able to comment on other people's posts. Furthermore, the user will be able to manag their account, change their profile picture, change their bio description and so much more. Read more below to learn about all of the app's features.
</p>

## App Background
I first began this project during the Fall semester of 2021. During this semester I was a CodePath iOS Development Tech Fellow. In short, with another peer, one day a week, I taught a group of 15 students how to build iOS Applications on Zoom for about 1 hr each day. During the second half of the semester, the 15 students were split into groups of 3-4 to build their own app as a team. This is when I decided to build this app, so I could join my peers in this challenge. This then led me to begin designing on a Figma page, and below you'll see the final product.

## Figma Design
Below is the Figma Design that I started from scratch as I thought of features to add to my application.

        - Let's first begin with signing into the app, via Google:
            - <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/cYMNjPT.gif" style="width: 200px; height 200px;">
        - Next, the user is also able to sign in via Apple, but I'm not able to display it here, because Apple Sign In isn't allowed via a Simulator
        - Next, after signing in, the user will be able to see their profile picture, profile bio description, see how many posts they have, how many people liked their posts, and will have a Settings button, which I'll go into in a second.
            - <img src= "https://i.imgur.com/00UoyI2.gif" style="width: 200px; height 200px;">
        - Settings Page: at the top right in the Profile view, the user will be able to click on it, and in their they will have many options, which include changing their bio name, bio description, uploading a new profile image, signing out and much more.

## Future Features
In the future, I would like to add a feature where the user will be able to follow any users that they would like, the user can search for specific users, make a separate tab to show app activitiy of users they follow, and a feature where the user would be able to upload short videos. If I do, add these features, then that's when I would publish this app into the App Store.

## Wrap Up
I hope you enjoyed my project. I'll continue working on it.
